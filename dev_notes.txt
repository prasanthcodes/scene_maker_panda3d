issues to check
-----------------------------------
1. model files should loaded from current relative path. when loading from outside of current folder, there is a error occurs
2. when clicking on 'remove animation' in GUI, animation names are not immediately removed, but it will not shown next restart.
3. (fixed). when actor is on, the model did not change its pos,scale,.. (workdone: actor is reparented to new node)
4. (fixed). when an actor is parented to another actor and when the parent is changed to actor to non-actor to actor , childs animations duplicated and child is not displaying.
5. (fixed). in simplepbr, ralph model colors look bleached(due to tonemapping). analyse the possibility to make ralph model colors same as autoshader. (workdone: tonemapping removed).
6. using simplepbr, if shadow is enabled and autoshader applied to ralph model. shadow acne occurs (when autoshader not applied no acne)

---------------------------

in 'model parent editor', update gui when
(done) * new model loaded
(done) * unique name changed
(done) * model enabled

(done) when unique name of a model is changed, we need to find the parent name of all models and update its names

5-6-2025
new branch 'skybox_terrain' is created in GitHub

7-7-2024
simplepbr is forked and an option is created to enable or disable tonemapping.



to do
---------------------------------
1. change the 'model nodepath viewer' gui to treeview.
2. add buttons to create new pointlight, new empty node. (if needed)
3. create gui for 'setlight' functionality of ambient,directional,point lights



to do raw
-------------------------------

convert ralph model to glb format.
skybox can be set in simplepbr. but skybox not shown.
